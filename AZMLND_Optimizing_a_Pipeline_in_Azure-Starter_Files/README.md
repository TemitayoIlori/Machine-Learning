# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, I built and optimized an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**Problem statement:**
For this project, a file was provided that contains bank marketing iformation. It cotains data about prospective customers. The target column (y) indicates if a customer subscribed to a fixed term deposit. This project will be a classication model that predicts if a customer will subscribe to a fixed term deposit with a financial institution.
**Solution:**
The best performing model was VotingEnsemble with an accuracy of 0.9168.
## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
I used RandomParameterSampling with choice. I used SKLearn estimator for my python script. Primary metrics was Accuracy and the primary metric goal is to maximize accuracy. Accuracy of the best child run is 0.90794.

**Benefits of the parameter sampler chosen?**
I chose RandomParameterSampling parameter sampler and provided values for C (which are not big enough to cause over-fitting) and max_iter, the number of iterations over the data. The experiment will not run more than the specified number of iterations. 
**Benefits of the early stopping policy chosen?**
I chose BanditPolicy as the early stopping policy chosen, with evaluation_interval=1, slack_factor=0.1, delay_evaluation=5. This terminates runs that are not performing well. Precisely, it evaluates every step and terminates a run that is not within 10% of te best performing run. This saves time.

## AutoML
**The model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

Top four features are duration nr.employed, emp.var.rate and cons.conf.idx.
There were 23 iterations. VotingEnsemble is the algorithm with the best performance. The best run took 01:40 minutes and had an accuracy of 0.9168. The most important features are: duration, emp.var.rate, nr.employed and euribor3m. AUC_macro=0.947, AUC_micro=0.981 and AUC_weighted=0.947

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**
The AutoML model performed better and is faster than the Scikit-learn pipeline. It had an accuracy of 0.9168 versus 0.90794 for Scikit-learn. AutoML performs better because hyperparameter optimization is automated.
## Future work
**Improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
I will try Bayesian sampling as a parameter sampler. Since it picks samples based on the performance of previous samples, it can help improve primary metric.
